### 🌿 The Story Begins Here

What if learning Python felt like opening a journal instead of a textbook?  
Like building something sacred in the middle of startup noise and spiritual stillness?  
What if every line of code came with a little more character—and maybe a little more clarity?

Welcome to **The Third Hour Café Chronicles** —  
A beginner-friendly coding series told through narrative.

Set in a fictional Christian café where the windows glow with morning light, the Wi-Fi rarely drops, and every bug teaches you something about yourself.

This isn’t a course. It’s not a bootcamp.  
It’s a slow-burning story unfolding in the background of jazz, cortados, and blinking terminal prompts.

I’m learning Python through missions disguised as conversations.  
Slack voice notes. Scribbled whiteboards. Divine interruptions._  
The tools we build come straight from emotional chaos:  
Restlessness, joy, prayer, and late-night debug sessions.

And yes—sometimes that means building a vibe-check bot after someone cries into their cortado.

### 👤 Who's “P”?

I’m P.  
Rookie developer. Accidental co-founder.  
Trying to learn Python one story at a time.

And I’m not doing it alone. I’ve got a team that talks like prophets and ships like creatives:

- **Sarah** — head of vibes. Part marketer, part influencer, fluent in iced matcha and unsolicited caption drafts.  
- **Micah** — data disciple. Writes SQL like it’s scripture.  
- **Jordan** — creative director, aesthetic theologian. One foot in Adobe Express, the other in the Garden of Eden.

### 💻 What You’re Looking At

Each chapter teaches beginner Python—`input()`, `conditionals`, `loops`—  
through small quests that feel more like indie film side plots than code tutorials.

You’re not here for a lesson.  
You’re here for a moment.

### 📦 What’s Next?

**Chapter 1: VibeBot 1.0™**  
The café is waking up.  
A voice note from Sarah changes everything.

The first coding quest?  
Small. Silly. Sacred.  
And living in the terminal.
